# Compus: The Campus Compass

## Description

Compus is a mobile web app designed to assist users in navigating large university campuses with ease. Inspired by the challenges of finding buildings on the Kansas State University campus, Compus provides an intuitive directional arrow similar to a compass, guiding users to their desired campus locations. 

With Compus, users can select any building from an alphabetized catalog, eliminating the confusion often associated with traditional campus maps. Once a building is selected, the app displays a directional arrow pointing towards the chosen destination based on the user's current location. This approach ensures users can navigate confidently without being overwhelmed by excessive information.
